# The Touch Box

This depository contains an app I developed as a technical trial, for the Augmenteo society, based in Lille, France: https://augmenteo.com

This is a simple AR app developed with Unity3D and the Vuforia API. It contains a script which is able to detect what's the weather on your current location, and modify what's displaying on the application.

I used the photogrammetry technic to modelize my face in the application, with Agisoft Metashape.
